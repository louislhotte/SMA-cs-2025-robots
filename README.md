# Our Approach

The ambition of this project being quite daunting, we decided to take the project step by step.
- Firstly, we interacted with the mesa and solara library to plot a single graph and wastes randomly, as well as the rules. At this point, the agent did not interact with each other. This was step 1.
- Step 2, we implemented agents that move randomly, collect wastes and transform them once they have gathered two of them. Red ones then put them on the disposal zone, getting rid of them altogether. 
- Step 3 consisted in implementing agents that can communicate with each other (for instance tell the nearest yellow agent that they transformed a yellow waste on their feet so that the yellow agent can collect it, etc...)
- Step 4 consisted in fine-tuning the heuristics and communication rules to leverage multi-agent strength (inspired by ants' pheromone as the teachers said) for the best performance possible.
- Step 5 was not implemented due to time constraints but the goal was to compare the zone limitations of yellow and red agents for better path optimization (detailed in choice section)

## Our solution

![Solara Front-end Application](assets/Legend.jpg)
We implemented four main blocs:
<strong>
- Initialization parameters
- Simulation buttons (play, step, count)
- Simulation environment grid
- Waste History Graph
</strong>

Each are detailed on the image and allow us to use the algorithm as per our liking (whether it be the size of the grid, the number of agents or more). 
For better UX, we limited the range of the initialization parameter for best performance, otherwise the run can become quite long as they would interact with each other. Even though the **inference time** was not one of our metric, we still hoped to offer best experience to the user through this limitation.

## Choices & constraints

Step 1 and 2 were pretty standard as per the project's transcript.

However, starting from step 3, we had to make some choices. At first, we thought about using complex algorithms such as shortest path algorithm, but then we thought that it would not match the course's goal of making agents communicate. As such, we **added** a constraint limiting the vision of agents to their current position (as in they can't know where the closest waste of their colour is unless they step on it). Although this added complexity to the algorithm, it also made the communicate much more relevant in the project.

After several tries, we also realized that limiting the communication to waste location was the right thing to do as otherwise, the simulations become slow and much less evaluating them properly, just running them once took quite a long time.

In terms of heuristic choices, in step 2, 3 and 4, we decided to allow the yellow (resp. red) agents to freely move in green (resp. green and yellow) zones so that they could cover a bigger area and communicate with the green agents. We planned to compare this feature in step 5, but lacked time to implement it. As we are writing this, we do realize that maybe it would have been more efficient to just leave them to their zone and restrict them as the longest part of the simulation is left to the exploration and finding of the last wastes.

In step 4, we fixed a couple of id bugs that made our simulations slower and implemented a memory preventing the agents from exploring the same square twice. In other words, inspiring ourselves from ants' collective intelligence and pheromones, their actions allow to generate a collective map that they update with each square they explore (0 for empty squares, 1 for green waste, 2 for yellow waste, 3 for red waste, -1 for unexplored). This was a feature that was especially tough to implement as we realized the agents were sometimes stuck or took unoptimized paths. However, we persevered and added heuristic strategy (S-shape trajectory, shortest agent communication for waste collection etc...) allowing for best performance.

</div>

To evaluate the algorithms, we ran between 2 and 5 simulations to limit variance.

Lastly, starting from step 3, we implemented a rule allowing agents to not drop the waste on their feet, but instead drop it in waste collection zones, allowing for better communication between agents.


## Criteria for success
Because our approach has a random component (stochastic nature of the agents movement), in all steps including the fine-tuned one, we decided that we would evaluate our algorithm using a custom feature: **the number of steps before 90% of the wastes are collected**. After all, finding the last waste could be done in a couple of steps, or, in the worst case, in hundreds.

# Problem Overview and Constraints
In all honesty, the below section was generated with chatgpt to reflect our understanding of the project.

## 🌍 Problem Overview  
The objective is to model and simulate a **multi-agent system** of robots 🤖 that **collect**, **transform**, and **transport hazardous waste** ☢️ in a hostile environment. The environment consists of different **radioactive zones**, and the robots must work within their capabilities to efficiently manage waste disposal.  
The mission involves:  
- 🧹 **Collecting** waste from designated areas.  
- 🔄 **Transforming** waste from one type to another.  
- 🚛 **Transporting** transformed waste to a secure disposal area.  
- 🧭 **Navigating** the environment while adhering to movement restrictions imposed by radioactivity levels.

---

## ⚠️ Environmental Constraints  
The environment is divided into **three distinct zones**, each with increasing levels of radioactivity:

1. 🟢 **Zone 1 (Low Radioactivity)**: Contains randomly placed **green waste** ♻️.  
2. 🟡 **Zone 2 (Medium Radioactivity)**: Intermediate area for **waste transformation**.  
3. 🔴 **Zone 3 (High Radioactivity)**: Final destination where **transformed red waste** must be stored securely.

### 🗑️ Waste Types:
- ♻️ **Green Waste**: Initial waste collected from Zone 1.  
- 💛 **Yellow Waste**: Transformed from green waste.  
- ❤️ **Red Waste**: Transformed from yellow waste and stored in Zone 3.

---

## 🤖 Robot Constraints  

### 🟢 Green Robot:
- 🧭 Moves within **Zone 1 only**.  
- ♻️ Collects **2 green wastes** → 🔄 Transforms into **1 yellow waste**.  
- 🚚 Transports **1 yellow waste** eastward ➡️.

### 💛 Yellow Robot:
- 🧭 Moves within **Zones 1 and 2**.  
- 💛 Collects **2 yellow wastes** → 🔄 Transforms into **1 red waste**.  
- 🚚 Transports **1 red waste** eastward ➡️.

### 🔴 Red Robot:
- 🧭 Moves within **Zones 1, 2, and 3**.  
- ❤️ Collects **1 red waste** → 🚛 Transports it to the **waste disposal zone** in Zone 3.
